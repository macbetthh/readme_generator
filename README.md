## Installation

To use this README generator, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) installed on your machine. If you don't need set-up help, move on to [Usage](#usage) for functionality. 

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git 
&nbsp;

2. **Now -- in your terminal, navigate to your Project Directory**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
&nbsp;

3. **Install Required Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
&nbsp;

4. **Run the app and let the magic happen See **
    ```bash
    node index.js
&nbsp;

## Usage
Follow these steps to generate your README file -- see Screeshots for visual based examples:

1. **Start the Application:**
&nbsp;
   
   - Makes sure you're in the right directory. Then, run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   node index.js
&nbsp;

2. **Answer the Prompts:**
&nbsp;

    - You will be asked a series of questions about your project.
        
        &nbsp;

    - Provide your project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, license type, contribution guidelines, test instructions, credits, GitHub username, and email address.

&nbsp;

3. **View the Generated README:**
&nbsp;

    - After answering all the prompts, a `README.md` file will be generated in the `generated-readme` directory.
        
        &nbsp;

    - Open this file in a markdown view or text editor to see the result
    &rarr;    ```üí°Tip: I use the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension in VSCode. ```

&nbsp;

4. **Edit if Necessary:**
&nbsp;

    - You can manually edit the generated README file to make any additional changes or improvements (like I've done in this one you're reading currently).
